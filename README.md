# Wikipedia Sticky Headers
_Make table headers sticky on Wikipedia_

I was looking at a long table on a [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_solar_eclipses_in_the_21st_century) recently and realized I had to scroll alll the way up when I wondered _What does that column mean?_. It got me thinking: this definitely wasn't the first time I've run into this problem. But somebody else _must've_ run into it too! I knew there were a ton of browser extensions related to Wikipedia so I went looking; surely with all their fancy ways of "improving" the site they had this covered. But after a few fruitless result pages, I got that ol' feeling -- time to make my own!

When I went to go publish this baby for that somebody else who must've run into this, I learned I'd first have to pay $5 set up a Developer Account for the Chrome Web Store! I didn't really feel like doing that. Maybe I'll come around to it eventually. In the meantime, this repo contains everything you need to attach the extension locally to your own browser.
