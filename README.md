# Wikipedia Sticky Headers
_Make table headers sticky on Wikipedia_

I was looking at a long table on in [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_solar_eclipses_in_the_21st_century) recently and realized I had to scroll all the way up to the top when I wondered "What does that column mean?". It got me thinking that this definitely wasn't the first time I ran into this problem. I knew there were a ton of browser extensions related to Wikipedia so I went looking. Surely with all their fancy ways of "improving" the site they had this covered. After a little bit of looking, I got that ol' feeling -- time to make my own!

When I went to go publish this baby for others to enjoy, I learned I'd have to pay $5 set up a Developer Account for the Chrome Web Store first! I didn't really feel like doing that. Maybe I'll come around to it eventually. In the meantime, this repo contains everything you need to attach the extension locally to your own browser.

## Set up

- Download this repo.
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.
- You'll need to enable `Developer mode` in the top-right.
- Click `Load unpacked` and choose this folder.

And that ought to do it! You should now see the extension available in your Extensions and it should run only on Wikipedia pages.

## Notes

There's a 1 second delay before it works on a page. See code comments for more details.
